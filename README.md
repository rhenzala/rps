# Rock Paper Scissor

### Short Description
A browser-based game where the user can play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissor game against the computer.
The interface for this one is simple. It consists of three buttons each for the pick of the player. A scoreboard is shown above along with the selected picks of the player and the computer. Below it displays if the game round is a draw, the player win, or the player lose. Once one of them has reached a score of 5, the interface is cleared to display the game winner and a reset button if the player decided to play again.
